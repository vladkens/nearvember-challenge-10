A cross-contract call is when one smart contract calls another. You can find out more about NEAR cross-contract calls [here](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/xcc-receipts).
What to do:
Write a smart contract (A) that calls another contract (B). Use any language you'd like.
Contract A should use data returned from Contract B
You can implement this however you like. Some examples:

- Contract A allows a user to log in, then calls Contract B to see how much NEAR they have in their wallet. Contract A returns 'Wow!' if there is more than 10 NEAR or 'Uh oh' if it is below 10 NEAR.'
- Contract A allows a user to log in, then calls Contract B which is a voting contract that returns if the user has already voted. Contract A tells the user if they have voted or not.
- Contract A allows the user to log in and pass another user's wallet. Contract A calls Contract B to see how much NEAR is in that wallet, and returns this to Contract A. Contract A sends NEAR from the user to this wallet if there is under 10 NEAR, else is returns "This wallet does not need more NEAR."

Deploy them on testnet.
